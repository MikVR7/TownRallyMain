# TownRallyMain
Approach 3 for TownRally game. App for students to make it easier to discover cities on city-school-trips.

Used techniques:

- Using plugins to communicate with map services like OpenStreetMap or GoogleMaps
- Using plugins to for AR-Minigames on certain locations
- GPS tracking of user

Currently working on Android Studio Foreground Services, to track positions of users while android phone is in sleep mode.

Planned:
- Connecting a group of users over WebRTC so that the teacher is up to date where the students currently are and for possibility to communicate with single students.
- iOS compatibility
- Rally Editor for private users
- Rally evaluation and review system

Project is currently under heavy development, so currently there is no useful testing-version available.
First prototype testing with a group of ~20 students is planned for May 2023.
